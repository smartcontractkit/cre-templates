# Workflow-specific settings for CRE CLI targets.
# Each target defines user-workflow and workflow-artifacts groups.
# Settings here override CRE Project Settings File values.
#
# Example custom target:
# my-target:
#   user-workflow:
#     workflow-name: "MyExampleWorkflow"    # Required: Workflow Registry name
#   workflow-artifacts:
#     workflow-path: "./main.ts"            # Path to workflow entry point
#     config-path: "./config.yaml"          # Path to config file
#     secrets-path: "../secrets.yaml"       # Path to secrets file (project root by default)
