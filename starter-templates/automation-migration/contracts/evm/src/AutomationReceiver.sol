 * @title AutomationReceiver
 * @notice Generic bridge that executes Automation-style upkeeps delivered by a CRE workflow.
 *
 * @dev Two independent authorization layers protect this contract:
 *
 *      1. INBOUND — answers "who may deliver a report?":
 *         a) {ReceiverTemplate} enforces the CRE Forwarder address check and optional
 *            workflowId / workflowName / workflowOwner identity checks.
 *         b) {_processReport} additionally requires that the forwarder is non-zero (closing
 *            the gap left by `ReceiverTemplate.setForwarderAddress` which permits address(0))
 *            and that at least one complete workflow identity option is configured before any
 *            report is accepted: either (1) workflowId is set, or (2) both workflowOwner and
 *            workflowName are set. Neither option alone is sufficient for option 2.
 *
 *      2. OUTBOUND (this contract) — answers "what may a report make this contract do?":
 *         a closed-by-default allowlist of (target, function-selector) pairs. The inbound checks
 *         do NOT constrain the `(target, data)` a report carries, so without this layer any
 *         authorized report could call any contract/function this receiver is trusted by. The
 *         owner must explicitly allow each (target, selector) before it can be executed.
 *
 *      Migration rule of thumb: inbound authorizes the workflow; outbound authorizes the action.

    // EIP-150 (63/64 rule): a CALL can forward at most 63/64 of available gas.
    // Without the `consumerGasLimit / 63` term, the guard under-provisions whenever
    // consumerGasLimit > 63 × GAS_OVERHEAD (~441,000). _processReport therefore adds
    // consumerGasLimit / 63 to `required` dynamically so that:
    //   63/64 × available  ≥  consumerGasLimit
    //
    // Pre-guard overhead (paid BEFORE the check point, so NOT part of `required`):
    // Up to four cold SLOADs in ReceiverTemplate.onReport when identity checks are
    // active (s_forwarderAddress, s_expectedWorkflowId, s_expectedAuthor,
    // s_expectedWorkflowName: 4 × 2,100 = 8,400 gas), warm re-reads of those slots
    // in _processReport (~400 gas), abi.decode of the report (~300 gas), the cold
    // nested-mapping read of s_callAllowed (~4,200 gas on first access), a cold
    // s_consumerGasLimit SLOAD (~2,100 gas), and paused() (~2,100 gas cold) add up to
    // ~17,500 gas on the first delivery to a pair. After slots warm, pre-guard drops to
    // ~5,500 gas. When the block-number monotonicity check is enabled for a pair, budget
    // a further ~10,000 gas for its two cold SLOADs and the advancing SSTORE.
    //
    // This pre-guard gas is intentionally NOT added to `required` and needs no per-feature constant:
    // it is spent before `gasleft()` is read, so the guard already sees it (it observes the reduced
    // remaining gas) and cannot manufacture it. Adding it to `required` would double-count and cause
    // spurious InsufficientGas reverts. The only caller-side action is to size writeGasLimit to cover
    // this pre-guard overhead on top of consumerGasLimit + GAS_OVERHEAD (see README Gas Limit
    // section). Under-budgeting fails cleanly (InsufficientGas if the guard is reached, otherwise
    // OOG) — both are recorded by the Forwarder as retryable, so this is a tuning, not a safety,
